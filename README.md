# statistics_on_text
A project in quantitative linguistics where statistics are calculated on [this](https://github.com/botvyns/statistics_on_text/blob/main/lem_pos_first.csv) and [this](https://github.com/botvyns/statistics_on_text/blob/main/lem_pos_second.csv) data (those represent the first and the second sample; for details see [this repo](https://github.com/botvyns/text_database)). Calculated statistics include:  

    1. absolute frequency
    2. average absolute frequency
    3. relative frequency
    4. average relative frequency
    5. standard deviation
    6. confidence interval 2σ
    7. measure of fluctuation of the average frequency
    8. confidence interval 2σх̅
    9. variation and maximum variation coefficient
    10. stability coefficient
    11. relative error of the study
    12. student's criteria
    13. chi-square

Based on the results the null hypothesis is checked too.
