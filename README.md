# statistics_on_text
A project in quantitative linguistics where statistics are calculated including:  

    1. absolute frequency
    2. average absolute frequency
    3. relative frequency
    4. average relative frequency
    5. standard deviation
    6. confidence interval 2σ
    7. measure of fluctuation of the average frequency
    8. confidence interval 2σх̅
    9. variation and maximum variation coefficient
    10. stability coefficient
    11. relative error of the study
    12. student's criteria
    13. chi-square

Based on the results the null hypothesis is checked too.

The [chapter_1.ipynb](https://github.com/botvyns/statistics_on_text/blob/main/chapter_1.ipynb) is notebook for dividing data into subsamples, creating frequency dictionaries and calculating distributions for absolute frequency and intervals (the later was performed manually in this notebook and automated in the second notebook). 

The [chapter2_and_3.ipynb](https://github.com/botvyns/statistics_on_text/blob/main/chapter2_and_3.ipynb) contains a code to calculate previosly listed statistics and check the null hypothesis.
